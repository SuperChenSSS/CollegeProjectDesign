## College Project Design
### Shortest Path

This project was designed by Qt Framework, and was constructed by [@HelloZhy](https://github.com/HelloZhy) and [@CMY](https://github.com/SuperChenSSS).

We use improved heap-ordered Dijkstra algorithm to structure data.

We have added several nodes across the platform. If necessary, you can modify them by adding more nodes on dij.h and Shortpath.pro. 

If you want to see the project demo, simply add this project into your computer, and it will work.

If you have encoutered any problems, please add PR to notify me, thank you!
